# MySQL Pagination
In this pagination, it uses mysql data to generate a article. 
Some rarely used functions has been used to count pages instead of using of ciel() to count.
All you need to do is configure the config.php. A mysql connection template will show.
Just connect your mysql database normally... or errors will wreck you.
If your design includes a animation like animation-timing-function and animation-duration in the css you better link the script or css style in the pagination.php inorder to show the content.
